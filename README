*** F1 Dreamteam Team Optimiser ***

== About ==
This program is designed to assist with choosing good-value trades for the
Sportal F1 Dream Team competition.  (f1dreamteam.sportal.com.au)

It doesn't provide any special insights other than informing you of the best
possible trade you can do in terms of maximising the total average points of
your team, based on what you can afford.  It is simply a way to speed up manual
analysis that could be done with spreadsheets.

Trading based on average points is a purely backwards-looking strategy and does
not take into consideration any predictions about the future.  Therefore, it
should be used only as a suggestive guide.  Of course there are no guarantees
that the strategy will be successfull.

In the future I may enhance this program to list the top 10 trades so that the
user can consider different options and decide based on their own preferences.

== Building ==
Build this with a C++ compiler such as g++ (Linux) or clang++ (Mac).  The code requires C++ 11.

On Mac I build this with: clang++ -g -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -o f1optimise f1optimise.cpp
(requires XCode development tools installed and up to date).

== Usage ==
Step 1: Update the drivers.csv and teams.csv files with the latest driver and
teams data.  The format of the CSV files is:

<name>,<avgpoints>,<cost>

This data can be obtained from the F1 Dream Team website.

The cost is in millions.  Eg. a $22.6M driver would have a cost value of 22.6.

Run: ./f1optimise [--single] <RemainingCapM> <Driver1> <Driver2> <Driver3> <Driver4> <Team1> <Team2> <Team3> <Team4>

--single: report only the optimal single trade, rather than the default which
          will suggest a single or double trade (depending on what is most optimal).

<RemainingCapM>: Number of millions you have in spare cash.  Eg. if you have
                 $1,500,000 free cash, then this parameter should be 1.5.
<Driver1-4>:    Name of the drivers (matching the first column in drivers.csv) which you own.
<Team1-4>:      Name of the teams (matching the first column in teams.csv)
                which you own.  If you own a team twice, specify it two times.
